It is only fair to mention the obvious Byrne influence of the album. Nevertheless, it is a duo representation of modern avant-garde and its roots in New Wave.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe pair will debut performances this coming fall, and give bereaved Talking Heads fans something to talk about again.

The light has an intense luminosity, creating strong shadows and sharp outlines between buildings and sky. The architecture is, to put it mildly, seductively eclectic, taking in old and new iconic buildings and a whole range of small-scale, quirky establishments - as one finds on Melrose Avenue, for instance. In fact, last year I completed a series of paintings of the fashion designer Paul Smith's store on Melrose (Paul Smith used one of these paintings as the image for a limited edition silk scarf).\n\nTL: Can you describe your process?\nJT: All of my paintings are oils on canvas. Due to their nature, that is, they are highly detailed and aim to capture fleeting moments, my work is based on photographs. It is not my intention to slavishly reproduce a photographic image, rather, the photographs represent the raw material, a resource to be worked on and interpreted - and involving technique, use of colour, composition, and so on - in the process creating a new representation. Some of my key influences are British artists David Hockney and Peter Blake, and American artist Edward Hopper. It was the latter who spoke of grasping the 'surprise and and accidents of nature'. While my position is congruent with this, I am also interested in grasping the surprise and accidents of photographs - light and shade, movement, placement of people, etc. Broadly speaking, engaging with the serendipity of the frozen photographic image.\n\nTL: What are some of your favorite subjects?\nJT: Most of my work takes as its subject matter the urban landscape of Los Angeles and the desert landscape of Joshua Tree national park. However, some of my paintings are of New York and Helsinki, Finland. Regardless of the location, what I am trying to do is create a strong sense of place - what it felt like to be there at that time - and for me this means moving beyond an attempt to reproduce a 'photographic' image. The paintings are, though, representational. At the same time, I hope that people enjoy looking at them. I suppose that a further dimension to this is that I visit these various locations as, in a sense, an 'outside' observer who is fascinated by the differences between them and, say, the urban landscape of an English city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\nmore information at www.john-tierney.com\r\n\r\navailable for sale at Saatchi Online]]>", "postid": "", "categoryid": "23009"}, {"category": "", "guid": "http://trendland.com/?p=81455", "description": "Men take note!

Likewise, Stella McCartney and Christopher Bailey didn\u2019t become big successes overnight. Similarly to many aspiring designers, they earned their stripes during Britain\u2019s Graduate Fashion Week, which is celebrating its 21st birthday this year.\n\nJames Greig\r\nFrom the 10th to the 13th of June, some of the UK\u2019s most promising graduates from a wide range of UK Fashion courses will be showcasing their work in order to win one of the many coveted awards. These include the Gold Award, a womanswear and menswear award and an international award. There are 15 awards to be won in total.\r\n\r\n\nAimee Ward\r\nIt was 21 years ago that Burberry's Christopher Bailey won the debut student of the year award and took his first step on the road to becoming one of the most important people in British fashion. When asked about the Graduate fashion week, he saluted \u201cthe most exceptional design talent coming out of our colleges here in the UK\u201d as well as \u201ctheir energy, their talent, and their well-earned and deserved global reputation.\"\r\n\r\n\nPenelope Tucker\r\nHe will be one of the judges for the prestigious \u00a320,000 George Gold Award, along with some of the biggest and most esteemed names in the industry, including Daphne Guiness and Suzy Menkes.\r\n\r\n\nAntonella Comateo\r\nMore than 1000 students from 42 universities are showcasing their work this year, making GFW the biggest event of the sort in the world, with 20 catwalk shows and a pop-up shop where visitors can buy graduate designs off the peg. Commenting on the success of the event, Lanvin\u2019s Alber Elbaz stated \u201cthat British students are flourishing because you have the best education system in England that gives Art & Design students the freedom to think, to dream and to do.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Graduate Fashion week was originally organized in 1991, as a way to unify the many British fashion colleges which at that point showed around the country with no synergy or focal point. It is now an unmissable event where potential employers, international media and industry figures meet to behold the creation of fashion\u2019s future.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTickets for GFW are still available at www.gfw.org.uk]]>", "postid": "", "categoryid": "80"}, {"category": "", "guid": "http://trendland.com/?p=81505", "description": "The Suno Resort 2013 lookbook, shot by photographer Christelle De Castro, parallels the set design motifs to the prints used throughout the collection.
